In the previous article, [Anticitera Island: The future of Artificial Intelligence?](https://deft.work/en/blog/2023/04/03/antikythera-island-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence/) We talked about the possible creation of the .ia domain. Can you imagine having a .ia domain for your website? It would be a way to show the world that you are at the forefront of artificial intelligence and that you offer innovative and creative solutions. With a .ia domain you could attract more customers, partners and collaborators who are looking for the best in this dynamic and competitive field. In addition, you could customize your domain with the name you want, from your brand to your project or your passion. For example, you could register domains like:

- learning.ia: to share your knowledge and experiences about machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and other branches of AI.

- salud.ia: to offer AI-based diagnostic, prevention, treatment and monitoring services that improve people's quality of life and optimize healthcare resources.

- arte.ia: to showcase your AI-generated or AI-inspired artistic creations, such as music, painting, poetry, design, and more.

- games.ia: to have fun and challenge your friends with games that use AI to create unique and interactive experiences.

These are just a few examples of what you could do with a .ia domain. What are you waiting for to register yours? Do not miss the opportunity to have an exclusive and original domain that distinguishes you from others. [Reserve your .ia domain today!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScj1paIvOUbqugD76fKncZ65ZOqL-f5bILycZComuxKhJeRPg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and [check the official reservation list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-aLEKfQySJeDgZd4QeHa57G9P9Pp4mqWhLJSqxcB0o/edit?usp=sharing) Obviously I can't guarantee anything, but since it's free you don't lose anything by doing it either.
